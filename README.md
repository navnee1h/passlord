### How it works :

> The password generation tool utilizes arrays as its primary mechanism. Initially, users are prompted to input their personal details, which are then transformed into uppercase, lowercase, title case, and other formats as per the specified rules. These transformed details are then stored in arrays for further processing. Additionally, the program reads from the 'rules.txt' file, which contains patterns guiding the password generation process.
